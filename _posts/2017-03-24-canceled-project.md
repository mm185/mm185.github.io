## ReSupply:   
This is one of the biggest projects I was involved in. Sadly, we had to cancel this shopping app. Mainly because of time and financial reasons. It was inspired by the "Amazon Dash Button" and should simplify keeping your groceries in stock. As framework Ionic2 + Angular2 + Typescript was used.

My Tasks:
* Project management
* Programming and UI-Design
