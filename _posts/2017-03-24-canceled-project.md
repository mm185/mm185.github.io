## ReSupply:   
This is one of the biggest projects I was involved in. Sadly, we had to cancel this shopping app. But it was still a good learning experience. Inspired by the "Amazon Dash Button", this app should simplify keeping your groceries in stock. As framework Ionic2 + Angular2 + Typescript was used.

**My Tasks:**
* Project management
* Programming and UI-Design
