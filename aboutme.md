The <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) <a href="/files/DeanAttaliResumeEU.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.

<span class="fa fa-globe about-icon"></span>
Grew up in <i>Tel Aviv, Israel</i>, moved to <i>Toronto, Canada</i> during my teens, worked in <i>San Francisco</i> after undergrad, crossed the border again to <i>Vancouver, Canada</i> for grad school, spent many months in other countries backpacking.
</p>

<p>I also have <a href="https://deanat78.wordpress.com/">an old blog</a>, mostly from high school and some old travelling trips, that I'll leave here just because I want to have a reference to it somewhere.</p>

My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
